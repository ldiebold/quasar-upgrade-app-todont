# UpgradeVue2 (upgrade-vue-2)

This app is designed to have **as many breaking changes possible** with quasar v2.
Why?
It will be used to create a screencast that will ease the upgrade process for newer users.

Here's the guide we will be using! (quasar next upgrade guide)[https://next.quasar.dev/start/upgrade-guide]

## Install the dependencies
```bash
